## Dev instructions
First you will have to generate the solution file, for this you will need cmake version 3.17 or higher
and Visual Studio 2019 (You might be able to use a lower version but you will have to change the gen-win64.bat file)
Once you have those dependencies please run gen-win64.bat, this will generate a solution file.
